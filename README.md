## What is it?
It is a Sample Test Site for users to test their site's performance, which is also used in my HZHSID Research Project, and the AP CSP Project I did in 2019.
## Notice
Before you deploy into your server, please check the `Precondition` in the `verify.php` to make your test successfully!
## Why the project choose the license Anti-996 and MIT license?
Because it is the most Chinese developers' hope. The code should be fun, it should be produced not only fits users' wants but 
also does not make developers' life worse. So that is the reason why the author choose this license- the author does not 
will to provide code for the companies that push their worker so hard and to make them work as 996. In addition, since 
the author prefer openSource, he also uses the MIT license.
## Found bugs for the repo?
It is okay to send your issues directly through Github's Issues page. In addition, you directly upload PRs.
The author would check these at least one time per week.
